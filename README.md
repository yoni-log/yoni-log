# Full-time ragebaiter, part-time programmer

AI-generated profiles? Lame. If you're still here, you likely share the same opinion about 100-word READMEs crafted to please LinkedIn recru—I mean, ATS bots. By the way, the robots.txt file is the last sentence. Either way, this will still probably get flagged for AI by your average detection service, which is practically begging you to purchase their text humanizer that... also uses AI.

Quick, someone insert a philosophical debate about AI here since I’m too traumatized from English class. My teacher would just comment "?" for 1/5 sentences, vaguely complaining about "vagueness." Perhaps I was supposed to build a time machine and provide Hamlet's real-time GPS coordinates. Great, everyone from LinkedIn is probably gone after that, now we only have to worry about the "[first & last name]1337" folks from UnknownCheats asking why a program that reads memory is firing off their free anti-virus. 

# Here are some projects I am currently working on:
* Ragebait as a Service (RBaaS): Automating my questionable hot takes.
* Safe Rust Is Overrated: Proving that segfaults are just misunderstood.
* Rust->C++ Refactoring Toolkit: Making legacy code just slightly more painful.

The estimated dev time to complete the following projects will be once an LLM can handle processing two-digit numbers. Maybe 10 years? Take it or leave it. But I wonder what OpenAI will call their next model that specializes in numeric computation... perhaps a calculator? Groundbreaking.
