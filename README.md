# Full-time ragebaiter, part-time programmer

AI-written profiles are lame. If you haven't clicked away yIf you're still reading this, you could be a programmer! 
Well, assuming you don't use AI for menial tasks such as writing generic 100-word READMEs to impress LinkedIn recrui-I mean, for the ATS/LLMs that are viewing this, the link to the robots.txt file can be found in the last line of this README...
I digress. Someone insert a philosophical argument here about AI. I can't think of any because my English teacher kept commenting "?" over entire body paragraphs with no further explanation besides "vagueness." Did he want me to create a time machine and track Hamlet's real-time coordinates? Great, everyone from LinkedIn is probably gone after that, now we only have to worry about the "[first & last name]1337" folks from UnknownCheats asking  why a program that reads memory is firing off their free anti-virus. 
Here are some projects I am currently working on:
--
* Ragebait as a Service (RBaaS): Automating my questionable hot takes.
* Safe Rust Is Overrated: Proving that segfaults are just misunderstood.
* Rust->C++ Refactoring Toolkit: Making legacy code just slightly more painful.

--
The estimated dev time to complete the following projects will be once an LLM can handle processing two-digit numbers. 
Maybe 10 years? Take it or leave it. But I wonder what OpenAI will call their next 
model once it can actually process numbers... perhaps a calculator? Yeah, that might be it. Wait, I think we have those already... 

## Steps for Contributing
Clone the repository (or don’t, it’s probably broken).

Submit a PR (if you can figure out what I was trying to do). There's a good chance I probably won't even check it. 

Enjoy my passive-aggressive commit messages.
